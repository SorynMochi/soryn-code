Backstory
Alax grew up in Feyshire, a small village on the edge of the Verdant Wilds. Raised by his mother (who runs a seamstress shop), he was believed to be an ordinary boy, consistently failing the annual Mage Finder tests. Unknown to him, his true mother is Alora, a powerful mage who gave him up as a baby to keep him hidden from dark forces seeking his unique power. His conception was magical—he has no biological father and was created by a spell gone awry during an explosion that severely injured Alora.
His early life was filled with longing to be special, and frustration at his apparent lack of magical talent. He is close to Kaylan, his girlfriend and childhood friend, and has always felt a pull toward something greater than village life.
Motivation
Alax is driven by a desire to prove himself, to understand his origins, and to protect those he loves. Once he learns the truth of his heritage, he’s motivated to master his powers, uncover his destiny as the potential Omnimage, and keep his friends (especially Kaylan and his real mother Alora) safe from those who would use him.
Flaws & Weaknesses
Insecure and self-doubting, particularly about his worth and abilities.
Naive, sometimes too trusting (especially of those he loves).
His magical power is raw and uncontrolled, making him a danger to himself and others until he learns to master it.
Emotional vulnerability, especially concerning Kaylan and his family.
Struggles with the burden of destiny and the fear of not living up to expectations.
Strengths & Abilities
Latent, immense magical potential (potential Omnimage: power over all seven elements).
Quick thinking and resourceful, especially in dangerous situations.
Shows courage in the face of fear, able to act even when terrified.
Deep empathy and loyalty, which inspire others to trust and support him.
Recent magical awakening: can unleash powerful, pure light magic instinctively when under threat.
Relationships
Alora: His biological mother, a master mage who sacrificed much to keep him hidden and safe.
Zax: Alora’s partner and protector, becomes a mentor/guardian figure for Alax.
Syra: Protector, but wary of his lack of control over his magic.
Kaylan: His girlfriend since childhood, fiery and supportive, later manipulated by dark forces due to her closeness to Alax.
Kelm: Mage Finder, friendly companion on the journey.
Morwyn: Antagonist, a powerful mage who wants to use Alax’s power for his own ends.
Additional Notes
Alax is a young man from the village of Feyshire, raised by a woman he believed to be his mother, living an ordinary life and often feeling overshadowed by his lack of magical ability. Each year, he is tested by Mage Finders and consistently fails to show any spark of magic, which makes him feel insecure and yearn for something greater. He is close to his girlfriend, Kaylan, with whom he shares a warm, teasing, and supportive relationship, and generally has a kind and loyal personality.

Unbeknownst to Alax, his true origins are extraordinary. He is the son of Alora, a powerful mage, and was conceived not through natural means but by a magical accident—Alora’s experiment with the seven elements went awry, resulting in the loss of her arm but also the miraculous conception of Alax, who has no biological father. This event fulfills an ancient prophecy: a child conceived under the blood moon, destined to become an Omnimage (a master of all seven elements) and potentially the reincarnation or vessel of a legendary being, Nyhm.

Alax’s early life is marked by a sense of not belonging and a longing to prove himself. He is adventurous, curious, and sometimes reckless, drawn to the unknown and protective of his loved ones. Despite his persistent feelings of inadequacy, he shows resourcefulness and courage when faced with danger. His most distinctive physical feature is his violet eyes, inherited from Alora, which hint at his magical lineage.

His world changes abruptly when, during his latest Mage Finder test, his latent power finally surfaces, shattering the testing sphere and causing alarm among the mages. He is quickly swept up by Alora and Zax (Alora’s partner and protector) and whisked away for his own safety, as the dark mage Morwyn seeks to use Alax’s power for his own ambitions. Alax learns the truth of his parentage and the prophecy, grappling with shock, confusion, and the burden of expectation.

As they flee, Alax’s powers continue to awaken, manifesting dramatically in moments of crisis. When Kaylan falls under Morwyn’s dark influence and attacks, Alax instinctively unleashes a surge of pure, radiant magic to protect himself and his friends, banishing the corrupted forces and saving those he loves. This act cements his role as the prophesied Omnimage, but also leaves him exhausted and aware of how dangerous his uncontrolled power can be.

Throughout these events, Alax struggles with insecurity, fear of his own power, and the weight of destiny, but he is buoyed by the unwavering support of Alora, Zax, and even Kaylan (when she is herself). His journey is one of self-discovery, learning to master his abilities with the help of the Mage Academy, and accepting both the dangers and responsibilities of his unique heritage. Despite everything, Alax remains deeply loyal, compassionate, and determined to protect his friends and find his place in a world that now sees him as both a beacon of hope and a target for darkness.

Backstory
Alora is a young mage from Avalair, renowned for her prodigious magical talents. She grew up in an era when magic was becoming harder to master, but always believed it was not waning—just changing. Her pursuit of greater magical power led her to experiment with a dangerous spell involving the seven elements, resulting in a catastrophic explosion that cost her her left arm and left her in a coma. During her recovery, it was discovered she was pregnant, her child conceived by magical accident under a blood moon—a child prophesied to be the next Omnimage. Alora’s life is shaped by her relationships: her mentor Morwyn (who later reveals sinister intentions), her close friend and eventual lover Zax, and her friendship with healer Syra. She is forced to give up her son Alax for his safety, watching over him from afar until fate brings them together again.
Motivation
- Initially driven by a desire to master magic and push the boundaries of her power.
- After the accident, her motivation shifts to protecting her unborn child (Alax), safeguarding him from dark forces (especially Morwyn).
- Committed to ensuring balance and resisting those who would use magic for domination.
- Ongoing: To guide Alax in understanding his powers, keep him safe, and atone for the consequences of her ambition.
Flaws & Weaknesses
- Overconfidence and a tendency to take reckless risks, believing in her own abilities to handle any challenge.
- Guilt and trauma from the explosion and its aftermath, including the loss of her arm and the burdens placed on those around her.
- Prone to secrecy and withholding critical information to "protect" others, which sometimes backfires.
- Struggles with vulnerability and accepting help, wanting to be strong for those she cares about.
- Her missing arm is a physical limitation, though she adapts with determination.
Strengths & Abilities
- Exceptionally gifted mage, initially with command over sky, water, and earth, and later showing potential for all seven elements through the use of runestones.
- Highly skilled in magical theory, runestone crafting, and experimental spellwork.
- Deeply knowledgeable about magical lore, prophecies, and ancient texts.
- Strong willpower and the ability to persevere through trauma and hardship.
- Natural leader, able to inspire and organize those around her.
- Resilient and determined, surviving catastrophic magical injury and adapting to life with one arm. 
- Deeply protective and nurturing of those she cares for.

Additional Notes
Alora is introduced as a brilliant and ambitious young mage, recognized as a prodigy of her era in Avalair. Even as the mastery of magic becomes increasingly elusive for most, she remains convinced that magic itself is not fading—only changing. Alora is driven by an intense desire to break new ground in magic and prove herself, often pushing the limits of her abilities through risky experimentation. She is passionate, clever, sometimes reckless, and fiercely independent, but also deeply cares for those close to her, especially her friend (and eventual lover) Zax and her healer friend Syra.

Before Alax’s Birth:

Alora spends much of her time in her modest laboratory, experimenting with runestones and spellcraft. Her focus is on mastering the magics of sky, water, and earth, and she shows remarkable prowess for her age. However, her ambition leads her to attempt a spell involving all seven elements, aiming for a breakthrough that could change the course of magic itself.

During this period, Alora’s relationships with Zax and Syra are central to her life. Zax supports and grounds her, while Syra tends to her physical and emotional wounds. Her mentor, Morwyn, is a figure of both guidance and eventual danger—someone she trusts deeply at first, but whose ambitions later threaten her safety.

The Catastrophic Spell and Alax’s Conception:

Alora’s pivotal moment comes when she attempts her most dangerous spell. The ritual spirals out of control, resulting in a massive explosion that destroys her laboratory, leaves her gravely injured, and costs her her left arm. While in a coma, Alora is discovered to be pregnant—an impossible event, as the conception is entirely magical, tied to a prophecy about the blood moon and the rebirth of an Omnimage.

After Alax’s Birth:

In the aftermath of the explosion, Alora’s life changes dramatically. She is physically and emotionally scarred, struggling with the trauma of her failed experiment and the loss of her arm. The revelation of her pregnancy—and the prophecy surrounding her unborn child—thrusts her into a new role as a protector. The child, Alax, is believed to be the reincarnation or vessel of the Omnimage, a being of unimaginable power that many, including the now-villainous Morwyn, seek to control or destroy.

Alora’s priorities shift from personal ambition to fierce maternal protection. She is forced to give up Alax for his own safety, hiding his true origins and watching over him from afar as he grows up unaware of his heritage. The burden of prophecy, secrecy, and guilt weighs heavily on her. Despite her physical loss and emotional wounds, Alora remains determined and resilient, adapting to her new limitations and responsibilities.

Her relationships deepen: Zax’s love for her becomes explicit, and Syra’s loyalty is unwavering. Alora becomes the emotional core for a small group fighting against the darkness rising around them. Eventually, Alora reveals the truth to Alax, reclaiming her role as his mother and protector, and recommitting herself to guiding him and defending him from those who would exploit his power.

In summary, Alora’s journey is one of transformation—from a driven and sometimes reckless prodigy, to a survivor marked by loss, and finally to a fiercely protective mother and leader, defined by sacrifice, resilience, and hope for her child’s future.

She has grown up in Feyshire with Alax, supporting him through his repeated failures at the Mage Finder tests and believing in his potential regardless of his apparent lack of magic. She herself awakened to fire magic earlier in the year, which set her apart as one of the town’s hopefuls. Her love for Alax is a core part of her identity.

Additional Notes
Kaylan is a key supporting character in "Nyhm's Legacy," playing a pivotal role in protagonist Alax's life and the unfolding magical conflict. She is a young woman from the village of Feyshire, known for her bright auburn hair, striking blue eyes, and energetic, affectionate demeanor. Kaylan is Alax's childhood friend and girlfriend, their relationship built upon years of trust, loyalty, and mutual support.

Personality-wise, Kaylan is warm, playful, and fiercely loyal, often encouraging Alax during his struggles with the Mage Finder tests and always believing in his potential, even when he doesn't believe in himself. She has her own magical talent, having awakened to fire magic earlier in the year, which makes her one of Feyshire's most promising young mages.

Her greatest strengths are her loyalty, optimism, and courage—she is willing to follow Alax into danger and stand by him in the face of uncertainty. However, these same qualities make her vulnerable; when Morwyn, the story's antagonist, manipulates her through dark magic, Kaylan's devotion warps into obsession. Under Morwyn's influence, she becomes possessive, irrational, and even dangerous, summoning shadow creatures and turning against Alax's companions in a desperate attempt to keep Alax to herself.

Kaylan's arc is tragic: she is both a victim of Morwyn's ambition and an emotional touchstone for Alax. Her corruption and eventual defeat by Alax and his friends highlight the personal costs of the magical war and the emotional stakes at play. Despite her actions under Morwyn's control, there is hope for her redemption, as traces of her true self remain and her fate is left unresolved.

In summary, Kaylan is a vibrant, loving, and strong-willed young woman whose love for Alax is both her greatest asset and her greatest vulnerability. Her story embodies themes of loyalty, the dangers of obsession, and the hope for redemption, making her a compelling and sympathetic figure within the narrative.

Additional Notes
Sevena is a sixteen-year-old dragonkin princess from the Skyspire in the Ironroot Peaks, newly arrived as a student at the Mage Academy of Avalair. She stands tall and stunningly beautiful, with a curvaceous, predatory grace. Her long, obsidian black hair gleams with silvery highlights, and her extremely pale skin is accented by opalescent dragon scales along her legs, shoulders, and upper arms. Elegant, prominent pearly horns curve from her head, and large, graceful pearl wings and long, clawed fingers complete her striking, otherworldly appearance. Her eyes are alluring and reptilian, exuding an aura of dark, mesmerizing beauty and power.

Sheltered by a life of luxury, Sevena is highly self-assured, commanding, and unapologetically ruthless. She is easily bored, disdainful of those she considers beneath her, and enjoys toying with and dominating others—often using her formidable dark magic to control weaker minds for her amusement. Sensual and charismatic, she wields her allure with confidence, seeking out those who present a true challenge. Her ambitions and desires are always directed toward gaining greater power, conquering new realms, and proving her superiority, especially by bending strong-willed or powerful individuals to her will.

Despite her confidence, Sevena is naive about the world beyond her palace, often underestimating the strength or resilience of others. Her manipulations and vanity can create unforeseen complications and enemies, and she remains unaware of the full potential and consequences of her family's secret blood pact ability—a ritual that can bond her to another, sharing emotions and location, but which she has never used.

Sevena’s strengths lie in her exceptional magical ability to dominate minds, her physical prowess as a dragonkin, and her intelligence and strategic thinking. She commands her attendants and servants effortlessly, regarding most people as pawns or playthings. Discontent with the ease of her conquests at home, she is drawn to the Mage Academy by rumors of powerful mages, viewing them as both potential rivals and conquests, and seeking the excitement and challenge that have thus far eluded her.
