Chapter 32
In the trailing shadow of dawn, the Mage Academy of Avalair awoke with a breathless urgency, as if the coming tournament strained every stone and blade of grass to a higher pitch. The towers, hoarfrost-clad, shimmered in the half-light, and students—both new and veteran—flowed through the archways in determined pairs and huddled knots, voices crackling with rumors and anticipation. The week before the coliseum’s contest unfurled itself as a crucible, reshaping the first-year class with a daily hammering that spared none.
Alax felt it keenly—the weight of judgment, the dread of expectation, and the unfamiliar, ragged hope that came from standing with those who called him friend. Each morning began with a cold shock of training, the ring of steel or the sizzle of elemental magic filling the brisk air as the instructors herded their charges onto the main field just beyond the great marble coliseum. There, banners for the seven elements knifed the wind, casting colors over the dew-wet grass.
Sparring was more than exercise; it was survival, and Alax knew it. He moved among his cohort—a nucleus braided from bond and rivalry, laughter and bruises. Edden was a fixture at his side, the bigger boy’s light humor and steady earth magic grounding Alax’s nerves. Amara’s fierce resolve, fire magic sparking hot at her fingertips, made her a challenge for any trainee fool enough to underestimate a “street rat.” Vance, sly and unflagging, flitted between disciplines, pushing boundaries with every sly quip and elemental trick. Sevena, simultaneously participant and queen more than princess, practiced with a predatory grace—her storms as precise as they were overwhelming, her mentorship occasionally delivered in a single cutting glance.
Routine vanished the moment swords were drawn. Alax fell in with his friends, but his gaze often wandered to Rodrick—a tall, silent shade among the initiates, the battered sword at his waist and the suspicious lump of cloth—Klem, always Klem—lashed at his belt. The first session, Rodrick hung back, haunted, hands flexing with nervous anticipation, blue eyes flickering to the exits or the patch of shadow under the stands.
But Zax himself stood at the field’s edge, arms folded, watching Rodrick with that warrior’s insight—compassionate but unsparing. “There’s no use in exile, Rodrick,” he called one morning, his voice sharp enough to slice through the murmurs of gossip from the older apprentices. “Go—show them what steel in the dark can accomplish,” he told him, helping him out of his shell.
Rodrick hesitated—then, with a shudder, stepped forward. His movements were initially stilted, as his gaze tracked the instructors and students alike, wary of ridicule or fear. But after the first round, the change was visible. His sword work—fluid, crisp, unerring—left the others groping to block or parry blows that came as inexorably as rain falling from a black sky. Earth magic underpinned every step he took, channeling raw power into unwavering precision; his boots rooted firmly, the ground answering without thought.
It was Edden who drew him into the circle, clapping him on the shoulder after a spar. “Spirits, Rodrick,” he gasped, grinning through the sweat and the ache in his ribs. “I haven’t seen swordplay like that since Grenwell’s last demonstration. You ever leave anything for your partner to work with?”
Rodrick blinked, taken aback, then managed a crooked, shy smile. “Klem always said—practice isn’t for the crowd. But,” he risked a glance at the others, “I… thank you.” His hand drifted to the shroud at his belt, squeezing the relic in silent benediction.
To Alax’s surprise, it was Amara who strode forward to challenge Rodrick next—a spark in her step, fire already crackling at her fingertips. The duel that followed rippled with anticipation through the morning crowd. Amara’s flames hissed and spat against the rising walls of earthen shield Rodrick conjured, each blow echoing with the rhythm of forge and furnace. She darted in, a blur of heat, and scored a stinging line of fire along his forearm—smoke curling where flesh met flame.
Rodrick only grinned, mud spattering his boots nearly to the knee, soot-gray streaks running up his scar-scarred forearms and darkening the rumpled sleeves of his tunic. He looked every inch the smithy’s son—rooted, battered, indefatigable—a figure carved from earth and iron, eyes fixed and clear as river stones.
The duel unfolded between them in a hush of breath and quickening heartbeats. Amara danced through the bristling haze of the pitch, fire kindling in her clenched fists, sparks skipping off her knuckles with every strike. She was swift and agile, a blaze in motion—her attacks darted and curved, feints flickering like heat mirage, her feet kissing the churned mud in slippery, perfect arcs.
But Rodrick met her with the implacable patience of stone. Every time she drove flame toward his chest, a shudder of earth rose effortlessly to blunt the blow, the ground itself flexing at his call with a craftsman’s intimacy—each shield thick as a kiln wall, each parry timed with the certainty of anviled rhythm. He advanced behind mud-caked boots, enduring each singed sleeve and scorched cuff without even a wince.
Amara darted in for one last, desperate flurry—heat swirling, her heel skidding for a clever low sweep. But Rodrick bent, dropped a palm to the ground, and the earth answered: a rush of packed mud surged upward, knocking her balance awry. He pressed his weight forward, sword sweeping in a clean, measured arc that caught her own weapon and sent it skittering across the pitch in a spatter of roiling mud and hissing embers.
Before she could right herself, Rodrick pivoted, planting his boots and lifting his blade in quiet warning. “Yield?” he asked, voice gruff but not unkind—his eyes, for all their haunted shadows, gentle in that moment.
Amara, chest heaving and cheeks aflame, threw back her head and laughed—a raw, breathless sound that cut through the lingering haze of burnt earth and sweat. With a languid twist, she straightened up from where she’d landed in the mud, firelight still flickering along her collarbone, and fixed Rodrick with a gaze that glimmered equal parts mischief and challenge.
“Alright, smith-boy,” she drawled, lips curled in a sly, appreciative grin that lingered just a beat too long. “Didn’t know you had that much steel in you—or in your hands.” Her eyes roamed unhurried from his sweat-streaked arms to the broad line of his shoulders, then back up to his storm-shadow blue stare. With a flick as practiced as a caress, she brushed a gobbet of mud from her cheek and let her hand linger a moment, painting herself with a new stripe.
Rodrick, still panting, blinked in surprise at the tease smoldering behind her words. He wiped a streak of soot from his brow, but her gaze anchored him in place. The fatigue on his face thawed into a smile—small, shy, but steeled by the roaring pride in his voice. “Not bad yourself, Amara,” he rumbled low, holding her gaze. “You may burn bright, but I’m tougher than I look. Forge has its lessons.” He gave a lopsided shrug. “Lucky for me, you fight with more fire than most, and you look better wearing it.”
Amara sauntered closer, her bare feet squelching brazenly in the wet earth between them. She lifted her chin, fire-damp hair tumbling wild around her crooked smile. “Careful, Rodrick,” she murmured, brushing a sooty thumb teasingly across his jaw. “Keep wielding that blade so well, and I might want a rematch. Or maybe just a second round, somewhere with fewer witnesses.” She arched an eyebrow, challenge and invitation swirling in every syllable.
The hush that followed shivered with something fresh—a snap of laughter, a current of heat, and the hush of the crowd melting away as Amara and Rodrick stood centerfield, mud-smeared, breathless, and just a little closer than before.
With each passing day, Rodrick drew closer to the group and to Amara. Sometimes he’d begin recounting a memory, “Klem always nagged me to stay low on the feint…”, only to catch himself, eyes darting to the cloth bundle, shame coloring his cheek. But in these moments, Vance would sidle in, leaning close with a jest: “We’ve all got our ghosts, mate. Yours just has more personality.” Slowly, the tension in Rodrick’s shoulders lessened. He began to laugh, tentatively at first—unpolished, raw, but real.
The week pressed on, the drills growing more intense. Sword forms blurred into elemental duels. Edden and Alax struggled together to master the weave of earth and sky magic—one rooting, the other billowing, until the instructors nodded, finally, in grudging approval. Amara, wild and resourceful, learned to fuse her fire with spirit threads, creating dazzling bursts of healing and destruction alike.
The group—Alax, Edden, Amara, Vance, Sevena, and Rodrick—became something unique, their strengths and flaws braided into a tapestry of fierce support and sharper competition. Sevena, who could cow the bravest with a glance, surprised them by offering measured advice to Rodrick after a particularly brutal spar. “You hesitate at the finish—let the sword find its home. The world is not won by half-promises, swordsman.” She flicked her hair, and Rodrick, cheeks flushed, nodded—a lesson received from predator to shadow, with more dignity than scorn.
Night ushered in not only exhaustion but a welcome warmth in the bustling common rooms, where laughter surged through the smoke of roasting meat and the clatter of tankards on battered tables. Supper was a feast of noise and comfort, animated by tales of razor-close duels and spectacular stumbles on the field. For the first time since his arrival, Rodrick was pulled from the edges of solitude—no longer the watchful ghost at the margins, but a presence drawn in by the currents of camaraderie and something else, raw and thrilling.
He found himself seated close to Amara, a fringe of singed red hair sweeping her brow as she leaned in, voice pitched low and wicked. She gleefully harangued Vance for dropping his blade in the mud, calling his footwork “a gift from the goats of the Ember Wastes,” her laughter warm and sharp as fire. Rodrick watched her, caught between amusement and awe—the stubborn tilt of her jaw, the boldness of her teasing, how light caught the freckles along her nose when she grinned. His smile came easier tonight, unforced, the wariness slipping from his blue eyes as Amara shot him a conspiratorial glance after each barb.
Edden punctuated the din with wild gesticulation, arms swooping as he reenacted his “legendary” wrestling match with a rune dummy—“It had the reach of a Frostlands ogre, I swear!”—sending Vance into a dramatic swoon against the bench and Amara into a fit of laughter that made Rodrick’s pulse trip. Even Sevena, surveying the room with queenly disdain, allowed the ghost of a smirk as Amara challenged Edden to display his earth magic on the spot.
Klem’s shrouded remains were there, tucked at Rodrick’s hip, as ever—yet tonight the bundle was neglected, a relic not of absence but of a chapter closing. For the first time, Rodrick’s focus was not fractured by the weight of his grief, but anchored by the vivid, living pulse of Amara at his side. As the stories wound on, he found himself leaning closer, elbow brushing hers, voice dropping as he added dry asides to her roasting of Vance and sly encouragements to Edden’s wilder claims.
Conversation turned to speculation about the tournament, bets made, and dares exchanged under the flickering lanterns. Amara let her leg rest against Rodrick’s, her words softer now, eyes gleaming with private challenge and invitation. He met her gaze, and in that hush before another round of stories, the swirl of the living crowded out all but the present, all but her. The wrappings about Klem faded into the background, eclipsed by the sharp, sweet gravity of Amara’s attention—and in the candlelit din, Rodrick, for the first time, let himself lean in, letting laughter and longing bind him to the promise of something new.
One evening, Alax caught Rodrick standing alone on the balcony overlooking the mist-steeped arena. Rain slithered along the stone, pooling where ancient wards hummed at the boundary between student and legend. Rodrick’s bandaged fingers stroked the shroud absently, but his gaze was distant, hopeful. Alax joined him, hands resting atop the rail, uncertain.
“You ever regret it? Holding on?” Alax asked quietly, nodding toward the bundle.
Rodrick hesitated, shadow flickering in his ice-blue eyes, then looked away into the mist-laced dark. “Not nearly as much as I regret letting Morwyn in,” he admitted, voice low, roughened by memory. “That’s what haunts me. Opening that door—even for a heartbeat—let something hungry crawl behind my ribs. Sometimes I thought I'd never get free.” 
He managed a smile—crooked, tinged with apology, but threaded with a fragile, growing hope. “But I’m learning.” He flexed his bandaged hand, fingers uncurling from the old shroud at his belt. “Feels strange. Good, though. I’m starting to remember what it’s like… to stand close to someone and not just be afraid.” His grip softened, lingering, but the skull in the wrappings was no longer his only tether to the world. For the first time, Rodrick let the living outweigh the ghosts.
Training stretched them to their limits. Swords bit into flesh; bruises blossomed; magic fizzled and exploded, sometimes spectacularly. Failures came thickly—spells unraveled, blades clattered. Yet, so too did successes: Rodrick’s parry saved Vance from a late-night embarrassment in weapons class; Amara and Edden began to trust each other’s backs; Alax found his magic easier to bear with friends shoving him into the fray, not pulling him from its fire.
The week sped on, each day blurring into the next—pain, laughter, new scars, and older stories rising in the dusk. By the last night before the tournament’s commencement, their group found themselves in the candle-lit hush of the great hall, sharing smuggled bread and boasting about imagined conquests.
Rodrick, now at Alax’s left, unwrapped the cloth upon Klem’s skull only so far as to reveal the faintest edge of bone—a gesture more of remembrance than worship. “You know,” he said shyly, “Klem always wanted a crew like this. Said life was too short for fear. I think he’d be happy to see me now. To see all of us.”
There was a quiet, as if even the torches bent near to listen.
Alax looked around at his friends—Edden’s easy warmth, Amara’s sharp pride, Vance’s wild laughter, Sevena’s imperious, secretive regard, and at Rodrick, whole and fragile, wounded and welcomed. He smiled, and together, they looked to the coliseum’s black silhouette, the promise of combat and legend waiting just beyond dawn.
“Tomorrow, we fight,” Alax said, his voice trembling with the certainty of hope—a hope they’d forged in sweat, in scars, and in the fragile miracle of belonging.
Rodrick grinned, hand steady at his side. “Tomorrow, we live.”
The others drifted off into the warren of lamplit halls and shadowed dormitories, voices fading with the last echoes of camaraderie. Only Sevena remained, lingering at Alax’s side as the turbulent warmth of the great hall gave way to the hush of starlit stone. Together they slipped through the winding corridors and out beneath the sheltering eaves of the Academy, breath silvering in the cool night, footsteps falling in easy tandem.
This had become their ritual—walking the moonlit gardens, sharing quiet confidences and hungers that words could barely contain. Each night, Sevena drew a little nearer, her predatory grace tempered by a vulnerability she showed only when shadows cloaked her proud silhouette. Alax, illuminated by the soft phosphorescence from the enchanted lilies and the glimmer of faint wardlights overhead, found himself stepping through fear and longing alike, heart uncoiling in ways he’d never dared before.
On the edge of the orchard, where the air was tinged with the memory of rain and the heady sweetness of damp earth, they paused. Sevena’s hand found his, talons gentle, the golden thread of their bond humming—sometimes bright with fierce pleasure, sometimes just a pulse of steady belonging. They stood quiet, letting the hush between them stretch, eyes locked; words, when they finally came, were little more than breath.
But as the last crescent of moon crested the treetops and the world seemed poised on a threshold between night and the first stir of dawn, a tension flickered beneath Alax’s skin—a prickling, somewhat familiar unease. It thrummed in the bond, a subtle undertow straining against the peace they’d found.
Sevena stilled, her golden eyes narrowing, scales along her collarbone catching the ghostlight of the wards. The hush around them deepened, as though the whole Academy had drawn its breath. Their entwined fingers tightened, and with that small instinctive gesture, the night—so often theirs alone—shifted, and the air between them caught the scent of something unknown, urgent and irrevocable.
Sevena’s eyes lingered on the deepening shadows as a ripple of unease passed through the stillness, tension sharpening her features. “Let’s get back to the dorms,” she murmured, voice velvet-edged with command, her golden gaze scanning the moonlit paths for threat. “No sense tempting whatever hunts the night.”
Their footsteps quickened, boots whispering over damp flagstones as they slipped through arches flanked by runes still glowing from the day’s wards. The garden’s quiet seemed expectant, every breeze a shiver crawling along Alax’s spine. By the time they reached the threshold of the dormitories—the ward-lights flaring with recognition and sanctuary—Alax felt his heart pounding, every muscle taut. Yet the safety of enchanted stone and familiar halls dulled the aftertaste of dread.
Sevena halted at the juncture where the wings divided, her hand slipping into his. Her lips found his in a lingering kiss, fierce and protective, the taste of her magic flickering between them on the invisible thread of their pact. “If anything stirs, if even a shadow so much as brushes you, call me. You know how,” she whispered, her voice a promise and a warning both, echoing along their shared bond.
He nodded, reassured by the heat of her gaze and the strength in her touch. Sevena swept away toward the southern corridor, her silhouette regal, hair tumbling like black water down her back. Alax watched her until she disappeared, then turned and made his way toward the men’s wing, each step lighter for the comfort of her presence within his very blood.

Chapter 33
Sevena slipped down the dim corridor, her steps measured, heels echoing quietly off the rune-set stone. The hush of the Academy at night was thick as velvet—a silence she usually found satisfying, the kind that caressed her nerves and set her above the teeming masses slumbering behind so many doors. Tonight, the hush felt wrong, brittle. Something prowled under the familiar lull of the wards: a discordant note, a metallic tang of magic that bristled along the arches and tangled up her nose. She caught herself pausing beneath a sconce, skin prickling, eyes narrowed into the gloom. Faint, unpleasant magic clung to the walls like cobweb. It made her tail lash once in irritation—a warning as old as her blood. 
She strode down the last stretch of corridor with her jaw tight, knuckles whitening around the carved lacquer of her chamber’s handle. Within, the air yielded at once from the brittle hush of the Academy to something lush and cloistered—an enveloping cocoon of cool silk and the subtle, dangerous sweetness of rose water and rare resins. She flicked the bolt, the metallic click sharp as a fang in the silence. For a heartbeat, she considered—again—inscribing her own wards into the grain of the ancient wood, carving her sigil deep enough to banish even the Academy’s sour magic. Any illusion of haven tonight would do. 
In the near-dark, her gown cascaded from her shoulders—a living drape of midnight and molten silver that whispered along her spine, pooling at the hollows of her hips. In its wake, smooth skin gleamed with the fragile sheen of moonlit porcelain, unmarred but for the swirling, indigo sigils that marked her as Skyspire’s true-born: a lattice of serpentine glyphs spiraling across collarbone, shoulder, and the small of her back, each inked design shimmering faintly as if they held captive starlight beneath the surface. There were no scars to mar her immaculate skin—no trace of old wounds or violence, no trophies from midnight duels. Her beauty was unmarred and deliberate, a flawless canvas that dared the world to mark it. Instead, Sevena’s only adornments were the sinuous, indigo sigils winding her collarbone and back: ethereal glyphs inked in drifts and spirals, each one pulsing gently with their own quiet light, betraying her heritage and daring anyone to find fault in skin as unbroken as polished glass. The draughty air licked along her newly bared flesh, raising goosebumps in its passage and coaxing a sigh from her lips: equal parts anticipation and defiance, the sound curling through the chamber as she tilted her chin, daring whatever hunted the night to press closer. 
Her mind circled back, restless, as she paced through the dim-lit room. Her nose wrinkled—the scent of magic, sharp and sour, still lingered in her nostrils. The feeling would not leave her. Alax’s absence gnawed at her with unexpected insistence. The blood bond curled tight beneath her skin—a golden thread humming with the memory of his presence, with worry, wanting, and the stubborn heat of her own pride. Alone, she did not like it. Not tonight. 
Shaking out her hair, Sevena eased herself before the carved vanity, moonlight lacing silver in the obsidian strands that spilled down her bare back. She picked up her pearl-handled brush and ran it through her hair with slow, meditative strokes, listening to the subtle click and whisper as the bristles moved through the unbound tangle. The ritual, almost draconic in its patience, usually soothed her—a spell to ward off the day’s follies and lull the sharpened beast of her mind. 
But not tonight. 
Her hand stilled, breath catching. A shiver—the hair at her nape standing on end, a pulse of danger—ran down her spine. She met her own eyes in the mirror, gold burning bright even in darkness, and sensed the shift in the air: a cold breath, a flicker of shadow moving where no shadow should linger. Instinct screamed—too late. 
A blow cracked against the back of her skull, sudden and severe, veiled in a net of magic cold and suffocating. Pain spiderwebbed through her senses, her limbs going briefly numb. She tasted iron, lightning, saw her own fierce face sliding sideways in the fractured glass. 
Sevena tried to snarl, to turn, to summon fire or wind—anything—but the world lurched, vision narrowing to inky gold. Another flash, searing and silent. The room dissolved beneath her, silk and stone and moonlight slipping away as if snatched by a tide. 
She slumped forward, the brush dropping from her lax hand, her body folding boneless atop the vanity, her wings sinking down. Consciousness spun out, vanishing into a dark tide. 
The only sound that lingered in the silent, perfumed chamber was the soft, relentless thrum of old, bitter magic—unanswered, unwelcome, devouring the last glimmer of gold from her eyes. 

******** 

The room stank of roses and scorched silk. 

Kaylan swayed amid the spill of moonlight and spilled blood, teeth bared in a rictus that trembled between joy and hunger. Her laughter, once the shy peal of village spring, now rang mad and sharp off the rune-laced walls—every echo a ricochet of triumph flung through the cloying dark. The opaline girl, the dragonkin princess, the rival whose beauty had scorched Kaylan’s dreams—Sevena—lay crumpled atop the polished wood, head slumped sideways, wings sprawled in obscene, flaccid splendor. Sevena’s obsidian hair snaked over the vanity’s spilled powders, her face slack, golden eyes turned toward a plane of unseeing silence. 
Kaylan pressed a boot to that sculpted hip and shoved—hard. The dragonkin toppled from the stool, striking the stone with a sound more live flesh than immortal pride. Her wings, unfurled and useless, fanned out behind her, blood darkening beneath the delicate membranes, scales catching the moon in shatters. 
“Who’s the pretty little blood-bitch now?” Kaylan cackled, the sound jagged as broken glass dragging in her throat. She danced around Sevena’s limp body, arms thrown wide, voice swelling to a shriek. “Not so regal now, are you, beast? Not so precious with your tail curled and your clever words. Alax is mine! Do you hear me? Mine, you scaly, arrogant worm!” 
She punctuated her claim with a kick to Sevena’s side—forceful enough to make a sickening crack, the princess’s body barely stirring under the assault. Kaylan’s magic, the black gift churning under her skin—Morwyn’s poison, her only ally now—coursed from her every breath. It infused Sevena’s mind with darkness, weighing her dreams, pinning her to oblivion. No flicker of bond would reach Alax, not with Kaylan’s spell draped thick and suffocating. 
“He’ll forgive me. Oh, yes, he will…” Kaylan sang, breathless, boots slick now with blood and perfume. Tears burned tracks down her cheeks, but she didn’t feel them. “He always forgives me.” 
Kaylan’s boot connected once more with Sevena’s ribs, the dull thud swallowed by silk and moon-shadow. Her laughter cracked the hush of the chamber, rolling mad and shrill against the gilded corners—the laughter of something untethered from mercy, from reason. “You’ll see, Alax,” she sang, breathless and wild, her lips slick with tears and bile. “You’ll see—you’ll crawl back to me when this serpent can’t fly, when her wings—her precious wings—are nothing but scraps on the floor!” 
Sevena’s body shifted minutely, a pulse of breath bubbling through blood, but she could no more stop Kaylan than a corpse could argue the grave. Her golden eyes, once so vivid, shimmered glassy in wan moonlight, unseeing, dream-locked by the thick web of curse that slithered along every nerve. Morwyn’s darkness pulsed in the air—sweet, sticky, and rank, a scent that thickened every breath. 
Kaylan fell to her knees beside the dragonkin, her hands trembling with anticipation as she unsheathed a narrow-bladed knife. Kaylan’s laughter swelled, giddy and ragged, as she pressed her trembling hands to the narrow-bladed knife. With a hiss of invocation—old, bitter, and slick with borrowed power—she summoned a sliver of fire, the magic spiraling around the iron with a hungry, living heat. The blade drank it all, turning ember-bright, veins of scarlet crawling up its edge, its tip outlining itself with coiling black and gold. The shadows in the chamber pulsed electric, every gilded line on the vanity’s wood throbbing with the threat of deeper violence. 
“Let’s see if scales and pride burn like the rest of us,” she crooned, half to herself, half to the pools of darkness brimming under the bed and in the cracked corners of mirrors. “Let’s see you beg and bow, my little lizard.” 
She knelt beside Sevena, straddling one limp, immaculate wing—its velvet membrane stretched helpless and obscene across mottled stone, starlit glyphs flickering faint as dying fireflies. Kaylan’s laughter shuddered out of her—high, cracked, wrapping the chamber’s velvet hush in ragged, jubilant hysteria. She leaned into Sevena’s limp form, the dragonkin’s wing splayed wide beneath her like a trophy, its dull sheen veined with pearl and shot through now with streaks of splintered, oozing red. Moonlight glinted on the slick blade, the tip tracing cruel, lazy arcs along the delicate etchings of glyphs inked into skin that was meant to be unbreakable. 
“Let’s see how royal blood runs,” Kaylan murmured, her voice a child’s secret made monstrous, the knife biting deep against the scale-lined edge where wing joined back. Sevena didn’t stir—her beauty fixed, lids half-shuttered, mouth slack, gold eyes lost behind Morwyn’s shroud. But as steel found flesh, as magic in the blade hissed and sizzled through the scales, the wing spasmed—only slightly, only enough to release a hot, slow pulse of blood as black as old rubies, running in serpentine rivulets down to the floor beneath. 
But Kaylan was far from done. Her gaze, wild and glassy, fixed on the sprawled wings—those magnificent banners of scaled midnight, symbols of a pride she could not abide. Her lips peeled into a snarl. The wings must be ruined—torn from their root, rendered useless, an insult scraped into Sevena’s legend and flesh alike. Nothing less would suffice. Kaylan pressed her knee into the trembling membrane, knife poised in blood-slicked grip. “Let them see you grounded, princess,” she crooned, voice shivering between triumph and torment. “Let them see you as broken as me.” The blade flashed, crimson magic boiling along its edge, as she brought it down again and again, each stroke fueled by a feverish, shuddering need—to mutilate, to unmake, to leave nothing behind but carnage and a ruin that could never heal.
Kaylan continued, unrelenting—a goddess of wrath wrapped in mortal misery. Her laughter spiraled through the perfumed gloom, wild and broken, each peal more unhinged than the last. Her magic tangled in the air, oily and bitter, the blood-thick taste of Morwyn’s curse wafting from her torn lips with every ragged breath.
She straddled Sevena’s ruined, severed wing, knees digging cruelly into flesh meant for the sky—a carnivore gloating over her vanquished prey. The dragonkin’s body was perfumed and bruised vanity sprawled in disgrace; Kaylan pressed her palm flat between slick shoulder blades, pinning Sevena as one might a rare, dangerous moth, intent on tearing loose the prize of its wings. She still had another to take care of.
“Still look regal now?” she jeered, grinding her knee harder, feeling something grind beneath with visceral satisfaction. “You always looked down that upturned nose at everyone—now look at you. Broken, disgusting, helpless.” Her blade—ember-bright, veined with black magic and guttering flame—traced lazily through the princess’ other wing.
The walls of Sevena’s chamber, once so lush and inviting, now ran slick with the miasma of suffering. Sour magic rasped along the carved panels, every whorl of rosewood fogged with sweat, blood, and the acrid tang of Kaylan’s curse. In the thin wash of moonlight, Kaylan was a ruin and a rapture all at once—body trembling with exhaustion, eyes wild and shining, her hands painted red to the wrist. The knife shook in her grip, its edge still gnawing at the root of Sevena’s remaining wing.
The wing resisted with a will of its own, flesh shuddering as Kaylan worked the blade with fevered precision, prying scale from sinew, sundering the strength that marked Sevena as more than human. Every cut left a whimpering hush in its wake—no scream, for the dragonkin princess was too far under, awareness drowned beneath a magic-dark tide. 

********

Kaylan's curses filtered through the murk, each word a distant bell clanging in an endless storm. Sevena’s mind tried to surface, to summon fire, lightning, wind—anything. But the old, familiar power only fizzled on the wrong side of a suffocating shroud. She clawed inward, scraping at the slick magic binding her: shadow, bitter and foreign, laced with the flavor of Morwyn’s twisted will. It swaddled her thoughts, smothered signals from blood and bone, and the golden bond she shared with Alax.
The sharp agony of blade on flesh cut deeper than any wound had before, but it was nothing compared to the void where that bond should have been. Alax—his presence, usually pulsing like a ray of sun inside her, reduced now to a faint, smeared echo as her blood drained. Rage formed in that emptiness, and then, finally, terror.
She was not used to terror. Princess of Skyspire, born to hunt and rule. The world clawed at its shape through her skin; even fears before had been bright and defiant. But this—this was the dread of utter helplessness, of being rendered less than meat, her bones scoured by a magic she could neither break nor answer.
A memory flickered in the depths—her mother’s admonition, ancient as thunder: “Dragonkin are only prey if they forget they are also monsters.” Sevena clenched her will upon that lesson, dragging focus back from the softly encroaching dark. She forced her senses outward. The copper reek of blood, the grit of stone beneath a leaking wing joint, the cold gloss of her own tears drying on her cheek—these tiny, real things rooted her. But it was no use. She was no longer the monster she was raised to be; she was just a helpless girl who might not survive the night.
Pain throbbed in time with the rhythm of Kaylan’s spite. It was exquisite, primal pain, but worse—an insult more mortal than any she had ever endured. A princess shocked from pedestal to abattoir, a legacy of beauty and power smeared into the gutters by someone too broken not to destroy. The humiliation thrummed as fiercely as agony.
She tried to move, to curl her tail, gather her limbs protectively beneath, but her body did not answer. Magic buzzed impotent at her fingertips: a trickle of lightning, a whimper of spirit, swept away by the oily slick of shadow-curse. Only her mind remained—burning, seething. Somewhere, beyond the haze, she felt a scrape of awareness: Alax. The bond registered nothing but pain; not even her suffering seemed able to reach him. Was he safe? Or was she cut off as punishment, as cruelty, as the simple cost of the pact misused?
Kaylan’s blade met bone, then cartilage. Sevena, inside the prison of spell and flesh, screamed—not aloud, for the curse devoured all sound-but the echo rocked through her memory, wild and reptilian and infinitely furious. Her pride would not die here, not shrieking and powerless in her own chambers while some abandoned lover carved history from her flesh.
She gathered every drop of will, every lesson of pride and pain, and pressed it against the clamp of Kaylan and Morwyn’s darkness. Fire, she called—not as magic, for curse smothered that, but as desire: fire curling her body on Skyspire’s heights, heat of her breath, the victory of standing bloody and magnificent atop the council’s defeated. “You are not prey”, she told herself, over and over, as Kaylan’s knife dug and agony threatened to shatter her.
Outside, the spell did not break. Bone snapped, wings tore. The golden bond flickered, blinked, and faded to the faintest glimmer, drowning in Kaylan’s curse. Still, at the very nadir—where pain met shame—something in Sevena clenched, something cold and coiled. She would remember every detail: the scent, the sound, the pain. She would survive. She would endure. And what rose from these ashes, beautiful or monstrous, would one day hunt this nightmare to the ends of the world.
At last, exhaustion overwhelmed curse and courage both. Her pulse slowed, dreams fell into silence, and the world went utterly still, save for the endless, pulsing memory of burning royal blood.

Moonlight pooled in a wide streak across the ruined chamber, gilding the pools of blood at Kaylan’s knees. Sevena’s wings—one nearly severed, the other hanging in shreds—twitched in the half-light, their grandeur undone. Kaylan, arms smeared to the elbows in crimson, slumped backward against the vanity, breathless, giggling. Her tears had dried on her cheeks, leaving tracks in the dust and grime of grief, as if she’d wept all color from her spirit.
Morwyn’s voice curled through the tangled air, a serpent among shadows. “So much for the blood-royal,” he crooned from the far reaches of her mind. “You do well, sweet girl. She will not trouble us again.” His laughter was a balm, a silk rope slipping through the night. “Alax is yours now, soon enough. All debts paid in suffering.”
Kaylan stroked Sevena’s ruined wing, her eyes far away. “He’ll have to come to me now, or have nothing. No one loves broken things but me,” she whispered, rocking gently. “He’ll come soon—all along the blood, all along the bond. I’ll be waiting…” Her eyelids fluttered shut, grief curdling into sleep. All around her, rose-water and blood mingled, sealing the night in heavy, perfumed silence.

Far across the broad sweep of the Academy, Alax jolted awake, his nightmares torturing him again. Alax’s night was a labyrinth of fevered dreams and restless, fitful dozing. The memory of his conversation with Sevena—her teasing, her warning, that predatory gleam punctuated by rare tenderness—lingered like the taste of storm in his blood, distorting the line between waking and sleep. Whenever he stirred in his narrow bed, he expected to feel the gentle thrum of their bond, the trace of her presence pulsing at the back of his mind.
Tonight, something felt different, as if the world hunched breathless beneath an invisible weight. In those deep predawn hours, he lay staring at the rough-hewn ceiling, listening to the rain whisper across the eaves, his fingers curled around Alora’s rune bead. He drew slow, measured breaths, doing all he could to chase away the edge of worry he could not quite name. The magic that had joined him to Sevena, wild and undeniable, was quieter now—a low, sleepy current, not absent, exactly, but muted as if she, too, had drifted into unusually deep rest. Occasionally, a faint ache flared behind his eyes or a cool tingle shivered along his spine, only to fade beneath the heaviness that pressed over the entire Academy.
He told himself she was simply exhausted, that the strain of lessons, strategy, and all their secret struggles wore at even the strongest. Sevena was pride embodied; if she wished to sulk, or slumber, or prowl into the small hours without speaking, it was her prerogative. Yet the emptiness along the edge of his consciousness unsettled him, no matter how he tried to talk himself out of it.
Alax turned, pushing off the blanket, bare feet meeting the cold, warded stone. The room around him was silent—no snoring of dormmates, no scrape of boots in the hall. The moon outside, swollen and ringed with raincloud, cast a wash of silver over his writing desk and the battered wardrobe. Shadows clung in the corners, stretching into long, uneasy fingers.
A restless urge drove him to rise and pace. He crossed to the window, pressing his forehead to the chilly pane, letting the drizzle lick away the anxiety clotting his thoughts. Somewhere, far off, a bell tolled, muffled by distance and the spattering storm. The Academy below sprawled in moonlit solitude—the gardens veined with silver, the towers blackened and silent, a city of ghosts awaiting dawn.
He tested the bond again, reaching out along that buried thread to Sevena, uncertain if he truly wanted to be answered. Another flicker—nothing sharp, nothing alarming. It was as if she slept, deeply and securely, or else masked herself in the way only dragonkin seemed able: closing the door with deliberate elegance to the world and anyone else who might intrude. Alax sighed, shoulders sagging.
He tried to conjure thoughts of his friends, to let Edden’s warm laughter, Amara’s dry wit, and even Vance’s irreverent bravado settle over him like a cloak. He pictured the tournament in the days to come, his mind dancing through each imagined duel—strategy, possibility, the thunderous noise of the crowd. But everything felt hollow tonight, brittle and far away. He remembered something Syra had said, days ago, about learning not to fear alone. Tonight the wisdom burned; he did not feel stronger for it.
Eventually, weariness claimed him once more. Alax returned to his cot and lay staring at the wavering darkness, waiting for even a spark of connection—some sign of Sevena’s arrogant scorn or bright, wanton delight. Nothing came but silence.
When exhaustion finally dragged him under, his sleep was dreamless, a blank expanse devoid of prophecy or pain. He awoke before sunrise to the cold gray light pouring resolutely through the window, the rune bead clutched in his hand. The dormitory was unchanged; all seemed perfectly in place. For good or ill, the world spun on, and Sevena’s absence—a quiet, closed door at the edge of his heart—remained a secret he could neither open nor name.
So he dressed, washed quickly at the basin, and steeled himself for morning. There was training to face, friends to seek out, and the relentless machinery of the Academy already grinding into motion. Whatever storm had passed or was still coming, Alax stepped into the day with his uncertainty hidden, the bond’s silence an unresolved chord deep within his bones. Sevena would appear when she wished, he told himself—she always did. Until then, he put aside the silence and left the room for breakfast.
Chapter 34
Alax’s footsteps echoed down the stone hallway in the fragile light of morning, each stride sounding louder than necessary in the hush that followed sleeplessness. A cold rain spattered the academy’s eaves beyond the slim, jeweled windows, the sound like a thousand whispered secrets, too faint to name but too present to ignore. He’d slept badly, less because of any dream he could recall, more because of the peculiar emptiness yawning at the back of his consciousness, a hush where Sevena’s presence was supposed to hum. The blood pact had not snapped. It was silent, as if it were hibernating or blocked from his perception. He pressed his palm to his ribs more than once as he moved, as if the touch might coax the bond back into fullness, as if it could summon her voice just by the brush of skin.
But there was nothing except his own tension of muscle and bone, the hungry ache of worry settling over him heavier the longer it was left unanswered.
He paused at the end of the corridor, letting the murmurs of the main hall spill toward him—a chaos of apprentice voices, breakfast being served, the scrape of spoons and knives, instructors barking reminders for the coming tournament matches. He tried to swallow his apprehension. There was no rule against Sevena sleeping in after a difficult night. But her absence, the strange deadening of the bond, cobwebbed over his thoughts and wrapped claws around his resolve.
Edden spotted him first, already holding two mugs as if he’d been waiting for this moment. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” he called, voice booming and easy, but his glance lingered, searching Alax’s too-pale face for answers. “Didn’t think even Sevena could keep a wolflet up all night on the eve of the matches.”
Alax tried to smile as he slumped onto the bench between Edden and Amara, whose red-rimmed eyes and scraped knuckles marked recent drills or some private struggle of her own. “I’m fine. Just didn’t sleep much.” He forced a mouthful of bread and tried to join the others in their chatter. Still, the conversation whirled around him—Amara’s grim retelling of last night’s dueling lesson, Vance’s mocking bet that the storm today would knock the roof off the coliseum before the finals began, even Edden’s ribbing about socks and “dragon princess rescue fees.” None of it reached far enough to touch the void where Sevena should have been.
As the minutes bled away, Alax realized, with growing unease, that no one had seen her at all. Not at drills, not in the archery yard, not even at the student council office where she liked to show off her disdain for bureaucracy. He let the conversation fade into background noise as he turned every memory of the previous night over and over—her warning look as they parted in the garden, the tightening of her hand, the command threading her last words. Had she sensed danger? Or had she simply meant to remind him of their shared promise: if danger comes, call me.
His pulse spiked. He’d felt nothing in the night, no fear, no pain, not even the sharp spark of mischief that usually singed their connection. It was just… gone. Shuttered. He forced another swallow of tea, burning his tongue.
Amara’s gaze caught his, as unyielding as ever but now edged with real concern. “You’re twitchy as hell, Alax,” she muttered, voice pitched low so the others wouldn’t hear. “Did something happen? Or is the golden-eyed lizard just keeping her claws to herself today?”
He shook his head, unwilling to speak his fear aloud. “No, just—she’s not… here. That’s all. And it feels… off.”
The words seemed laughable, superstitious—a boy and his love’s absence, nothing more. But the unease coiled sharp as wire. Amara frowned, but let it be, pressing her forearm to his in the unspoken solidarity of outsiders who’d learned never to trust their safety to the indifference of institutions or fate.
The meal drifted by, interrupted only by the chime of the coliseum’s bell. Students spilled from the benches, eager and nervous, voices thick with anticipation for the matches. Alax retreated into himself, barely hearing Edden’s attempts at encouragement or Amara’s barbed joke about burning rings and “torching any fools who call me gutter-mage in the sand.”
Alax forced himself to shove the worry for Sevena aside, grinding it down beneath the press of ritual and necessity. He tucked the ache of the sleeping bond deep within his chest, stubbornly chaining his thoughts to the coming day. There would be nothing to do about her silence now; not until the day’s obligations finished weighing the scales. He drew a measured breath, feeling the bitter tang of anxiety dissolve in the warmth of the crowded hall. This was what he knew—noise, routine, the friction of anticipation crackling from every apprentice table.
The shouts in the corridor swelled as the bell tolled again, urgent and sharp—calling them onward, no room for personal ghosts here. Alax stood, shouldering his bag, and let himself be swept with Edden, Amara, and the others toward the main doors and the great concourse that led down into the belly of the Academy: the Coliseum.
Outside, rain smeared the air, turning the flagstones slick and the world to a shifting watercolor of blue banners and excited faces. The towers of Avalair stood sentinel above, each crowned with elemental sigils that glimmered faint against the pewter clouds. Apprentices surged along the paths, voices braided in a current of jokes, boasts, and anxious speculation—all of it threading together into a tapestry dense with hope and dread.
Alax focused on the rhythm of his steps, the flex of his fingers around the smooth bead that sat, comfortingly, in his pocket. He fell in with his friends, followed the stream, let the talk and laughter wash over him. Edden nudged him, grinning, and reminded him of their wager: last to be called to the dueling sands would owe the winner a week’s worth of chores. Alax managed a lopsided smile, clinging to the ordinary.
The coliseum loomed ahead—enormous, sunken into the very heart of the Academy’s foundation. Its marble archways shimmered with old power, runes glowing blue and indigo along every lintel. Alax felt the energy in the stones, the thrum that promised this was a place where legends might be written, or dashed to ash before noon. As they descended through the echoing tunnels, the roar of the crowd grew louder, swelling and fading with the pulse of anticipation.
Within, the arena was a great bowl of stone and wardlight, tier on tier of seats filled with apprentices, senior students, instructors, and foreign guests wrapped in fine cloaks and sharper curiosity. At the lowest edge, the sand shone pale and unmarred beneath a web of overlapping magical shields—each one suffused with the elemental power of the seven disciplines, each a promise and a warning: here, even chaos had its limits.
The staff gathered in a formidable line at the center of the sand, the banners of each element swelling in the cold wind above them. Alax found himself drawn to the spectacle: there was Madame Ariana—flamboyant and resplendent, her ceremonial scarf coiling like a living serpent as she swept a bow so theatrical it sent arcs of water and fire chasing each other in glowing helixes from fingertip to fingertip, bright enough to dazzle half the stands. Beside her, old Grenwell clomped her boot with the imperious clatter of steel against stone, her armored skirt bristling with daggers and throwing spikes, the greatsword strapped across her back so massive it resembled a slice of the mountain itself—ready, it seemed, to sever arrogance or granite with a single swing.
In their midst stood Syra, serene in dove-gray robes that shimmered with runic embroidery, her green eyes luminous beneath the shadow of her cowl. Her staff—grafted from spiritwood and wound with living vine—rested lightly in one hand, and her presence radiated a quiet power that softened, yet somehow magnified, the chaos whirling around her. Alora, striking even with a slight limp from her wounded hip, wore tailored black and silver. Her lone arm was bared to the shoulder, the runes circling delicately along the edge of her pale skin, violet eyes scouring the crowd for threats and allies alike. At her side, Zax towered—a pillar of red and gold, every line of his stance loose and predatory, the heavy Felring blade slung at his hip in casual challenge. His eyes swept the sands with an air of cocksure amusement and unmistakable protectiveness.
Elsewhere in the line glimmered the elegant Kalinda, lightmistress of the Academy, her robes trailing light with every step. She exchanged a wry aside with Ariana, conjuring a puff of cinders that curled up into a cloaked dragon, before banishing it with a snap of her fingers. The rune-master, Tatren, stood apart—bald and severe, hands stained with deep blue ink and ringed with ancient tattoos, his crystalline eyes so unreadable they might as well have belonged to a statue. On his other side hovered Marvos, the Earthmaster: a squat, broad-shouldered man whose arms, thick as treetrunks, were dusted with powdered soil. Even amid such color, it was Alora and Syra whose poise and gravitas held the axis of the gathering together.
All around, the other staff projected their own brand of authority: the alchemist instructor, Aurelia, sleeves slightly dirty already, conjuring a vine that wreathed her feet; the twin Lightmasters in mirrored cloaks; and, at the end, Zax’s old dwarven sparring rival—Master Ralven, stout and muscle-corded, the leather strips on his bracers carved with old victories. Katrina was there as well, all feline poise that looked ready to pounce with her magic infused claws. Under the brooding sky, as the Arena filled with shouts and magic, Alax realized that here stood not just teachers, but the living boundary between lore and legend, ready to test both students and each other before all the world’s hungriest eyes.
Drums beat overhead; banners flared to life, one for each element. The crowd’s murmur trembled in Alax’s bones, mingling with a fever of nerves and something sharper—wanting, the urge to see power unveiled.
A voice thundered from the stands—a sonorous, enchanted projection of Syra’s own, amplified across the coliseum: “Welcome, students and honored guests, to the Opening Day of Avalair’s Grand Tournament! Our finest instructors and Mage Finders will demonstrate the heart and edge of what you strive to achieve. Watch well. Learn much. Today, every legend begins with a single risk.”
A ripple of applause crested, swelling like a living wave around the sand-ring. The instructors took their places, partners chosen, hands flaring with energy and steel alike. Blades met, magic shimmered, and the world shrank—if only for a moment—to the bright, wild dance in the arena’s glowing heart.
Alax let his tension bleed away, if only on the surface. He would watch, learn, and hone his nerves to the edge. Today was for spectators and legends in the making. The ache of Sevena’s absence could wait. For now, only the roar of the crowd, the brilliance of battle, and the first day of the tournament mattered.
Suddenly, a young apprentice burst into the arena, weaving through the scattering staff, her cloak sodden from the rain, face pinched with urgency. She darted straight to Syra’s side, bending close to murmur frantic words into the headmistress’s ear. From his vantage in the stands, Alax saw discomfort flicker across Syra’s composed features, her green eyes flashing wide with alarm. Something in the timbre of the child’s voice stilled the coliseum’s rising energy; Syra straightened, her lips pressed thin, and with practiced calm offered the crowd a swift, gracious benediction for fair combat and clarity of mind.
But even this clipped ritual could not fully mask the edge in her gestures. Without hesitation, Syra turned and signaled to Kalinda—the Lightmaster, dressed in gleaming runes and trailing veils of shimmer. Kalinda, frowning, exchanged a terse glance before falling in step. Both women strode from the arena with the young messenger on their heels, Syra’s robes sweeping after her like the tail of a stormcloud gathering over the sand.
Alax’s chest tightened as he watched them vanish beneath the arches, his heart picking up a thread of dread. Whatever message had come for Syra, it had shattered routine. Something dangerous was moving beneath the surface—and for the first time that morning, the arena’s clamor faded into a cold, silent warning at the base of Alax’s spine.

Syra strode through the warren of back corridors, her steps clipped and purposeful, guided by the desperate urgency of the apprentice’s halting words. The message had been terse—blood, dragonkin, a chamber defiled, something about wings—but Syra heard what was not said as clearly as what was. Kalinda glided beside her, the Lightmaster’s veiled elegance a sheen atop burning resolve, her stride lengthening as Syra’s pace quickened. 
The corridors were cold, vaulting with late-morning shadow, rain-spattered light trembling through high glass. The air reeked of disinfectant and old magic, a bitter perfume of routine just barely concealing a deeper, metallic tang that made Syra’s skin crawl with foreboding. She drove her nerves into action, drawing up the old armor of healer’s composure, and gestured Kalinda ahead with her Light and Water magic, Syra’s own hands already summoning the pulse of Water and Spirit, feeling for wounds she could not yet see.
